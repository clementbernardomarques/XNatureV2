# XNatureV2

Context Deep learning have show to have good results on computer vision tasks: Image classification, Object detection, Image retrieval... However few efforts were invested in the field of X-ray image classification, and all the efforts in that field were made in the field of medical x-ray imaging. Thus we propose a dataset of X-ray scans of non medical images.

Content XNatureV2 is a datset of 2985 X-ray scans of natural objects (Gun, Knife, Razor, Shuriken, Key, Salmon, Fruits and Wood).
